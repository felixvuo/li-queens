given n : int

letting N be domain int(1..n)

given board : matrix indexed by [N,N] of int(0..n-1)

$ queens represented by a column id per row
find q : matrix indexed by [N] of N

such that

alldifferent(q),

$ can't be diagonally adjacent
forall r : int(1..n-1) . |q[r] - q[r+1]| > 1,

$ one queen per colour
forall r1 : int(1..n-1) .
  forall r2 : int(r1+1..n) .
    board[r1,q[r1]] != board[r2,q[r2]]
